1-  Install NuGet packages

2- configure "Ocelot" inside program.cs

3- Copy and paste "Extensions" folder from other projects (for eg. ShoppingCartAPI) in GatewaySolution

4- configure appsettings.json and add JWT

5- Then again configure program.cs and add authentication

6- Now we have to add all configurations inside appsettings.json file

7- When we have to configure ocelot , there are 2 things that we must configure:
      1- Routes of our microservices 
      2- Global configuration (Base URL where the ocelot is running)

8- We have to define "Routes[]" as array because we have many roues to define there

9- Inside Routes implementations we have two things :
      1- Upstream: The request is taken from upstream (Web project calling)
      2- Downstream: the request redirected to the downstream URL (the URL that API has in controller)

10- configure upstream and downstream for every single endpoint that we have inside controllers of microservices

11- When we define every ports of services inside (downstream - port) we have to update the appsettings.json
inside our   WEB   project (where we configure all ports of services) to 7777 (our gateway port) EXECP AuthAPI !
because it is isolated from aour gateway!

12- if we have two endpoints which there query strings was the same we can combine them inside one ocelot connection string!
    Like this: 
    {
      "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/coupon/{id}",
      "DownstreamScheme": "https",
      "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
        {
          "Host": "localhost",
          "Port": 7001
        }
      ],
      "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/api/coupon/{id}",
      "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get", "DELETE" ],           <-- in here we define both GET & DELETE requests in one section
      "AuthenticationOptions": {
        "AuthenticationProviderKey": "Bearer"
      }
    }

13- to make our appsettings.json clean we move ocelot configurations for every endpoints to new JSON file called as "ocelot.json"

14- Then to configure ocelot.json file we must go to program.cs and add some configurations for that
